## Details
Using the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#quick-start), provide 10 questions to the user that tests his or her ability to identify the artist that created a work of art from amongst 4 different pieces. The user will respond to a question similar to _Select the work created by Vincent Van Gogh_.

## Branching Strategy
* All work must be done on a feature branch
* No direct pushes to `main`
* All commits to `main` must be done via pull request
* Approving one's own pull request is not allowed
